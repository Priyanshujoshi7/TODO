Todo Application
Overview
This Todo application is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It demonstrates how to use Local Storage, a web browser feature that allows key-value pairs to be stored persistently within the user's browser. This enables the application to save tasks across sessions and manage them efficiently.

Through this project, you'll learn how to handle form inputs, manage local storage, perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on tasks, and implement event listeners to interact with the user interface.

Features

Task Management: Add, update, and delete tasks from the list.
Persistent Storage: Tasks are stored in Local Storage, so they persist across sessions.
Event Listeners: Interactive features allow users to modify tasks with clicks and input events.
UI Toggling: Toggle task completion status and update the UI accordingly.

Key Concepts Covered

Local Storage: Store and retrieve tasks across browser sessions.
Form Handling: Manage task input and validation through forms.
CRUD Operations: Create, Read, Update, and Delete tasks dynamically.
Event Listeners: Manage user interaction with tasks using JavaScript.
DOM Manipulation: Dynamically update the task list UI.

Technologies Used

HTML: Structure and layout of the todo list.
CSS: Styling for a clean and responsive interface.
JavaScript: Logic for task management and local storage handling.
